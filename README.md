#                feature detection and matching algorithm models

## Additional Information
This fork adds a tensorrt conversion script, slight modification to superpoint/superglue models to work with the converted engine models. See `How to Run` section on how to use the script.

## Introduction		

ðŸš€ðŸš€This warehouse mainly uses C++ to compare traditional image feature detection and matching, and deep learning feature detection and matching algorithm models. Deep learning includes superpoint-superglue, and traditional algorithms include AKAZE, SURF, ORB, etc.

## Dependencies

All operating environments, please strictly follow the given configurationï¼Œthe configuration is as followsï¼š

OpenCV >= 3.4

CUDA >=10.2

CUDNN>=8.02

TensorRT>=7.2.3

### Python 3 Dependencies

polygraphy

## How to Run

### Tensorrt Conversion
1. Execute both `convert/superpoint_convert.py` and `convert/superglue_convert.py`.
2. Once converted, the resulting models will be inside the `convert/weights` directory named `superpoint_v1.engine` and `superglue_indoor.engine`. Move these files inside the `engines` folder.

### Compilation and Execution
1. build.

```
cd feature-detection-matching-algorithm/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

2. run camera.

deep learning algorithms.

```
./IR --deeplearning --camera 0
```

traditional algorithms.

```
./IR --traditional  --camera 0
```

3. run image-pair.

deep learning algorithms.

```
./IR --deeplearning --image-pair xx01.jpg xx02.jpg
```

traditional algorithms.

```
./IR --traditional  --image-pair xx01.jpg xx02.jpg
```
